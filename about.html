    <h3>Data</h3>
    <p>This application lets users compare classification algoroithms on ocean microbes. The data was from the SeaFlow environmental 
    flow cytometry instrument. A flow cytometer delivers a flow of particles through capilliary. By shining lasers of different wavelengths 
    and measuring the absorption and refraction patterns, you can determine how large the particle is and some information about its color 
    and other properties, allowing you to detect it.</p>

    <p>The technology was developed for medical applciations, where the particles were potential pathogens in, say, serum, and the goal was 
    to give a diagnosis. But the technology was adapted for use in environmental science to understand microbial population profiles.
    The data was from SeaFlow environmental flow cytometry instrument. The SeaFlow instrument, developed by the 
    <a href='http://armbrustlab.ocean.washington.edu/'>Armbrust Lab</a> at the University of Washington, is unique that it is deployed on
    research vessels and takes continuous measurements of population profiles in the open ocean. 
    </p>
    <p>The scale of the data can be quite large, and is expected to grow significantly: A two-week cruise from one vessel can generate 
    hundreds of gigabytes per day, and the vision is to deploy one of these instruments on not only research vessels but the commercial 
    shipping fleet as well.</p>

    <p>While there are a number of challenging analytics tasks associated with this data, a central task is classification of particles. 
    Based on the optical measurements of the particle, it can be identified as one of several populations.</p>
    <h3>How to use this application</h3>
    <p>The raw data tab and plot tab are populated when the application loads. To see the results of a model,
        first select an algorithm then click on the "Start" button. When an model runs the first time after the application
        loads, it will take a while to train and build the model, so please be patient and do not click on "Start" button again 
        before the model completes.</p>
