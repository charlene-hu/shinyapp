    <p>This application lets users compare classification algoroithms on ocean microbes. </p>
    <p>The raw data tab and plot tab are populated when the application loads. To see the results of an algorithm,
        first select an algorithm then click on the "Start" button. When an algorithm runs the first time after the application
        loads, it will take a while to train and build the model, so please be patient and do not click on "Start" button again 
        before the algorithm completes.</p>
